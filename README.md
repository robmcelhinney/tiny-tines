# Tines Offline Coding Exercise - Robert McElhinney


Python 3 is required to run this as it uses f strings.

I used Python 3.7.2, I haven't test any other version but I believe Python >= 3 versions should all work.

Install requirements:  
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
## Using from command line
    python tines.py -j file.json
    python tines.py --json file.json

  ```
  python tines.py -j tiny-tines-today.json
  ```

## Running tests
    python tines_test.py
